# mm-oberbank
[MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com/) is a personal book keeping software for macOS. It is able to fetch bank statements from bank accounts automatically if the bank provides a HBCI/FinTS API. That includes most german banks.

For Banks who don't support HBCI/FinTS (which is most non-german banks) MoneyMoney provides a Lua scripting engine for building scraper extensions for web banking.

**mm-oberbank** is such an extension for the austrian **Oberbank**.
